## What it is
Using get Bootrap to bulid this page. I linked Boostrap CSS on heaad section of HTML file. I also included viewport to made Mobile responsiveness. all the code for this assignment is done with the Boostrap copy and paste but definitely adjust some of the HTML file code and created my own CSS and linked to my other files as well so it will work the way to want to make my page.
